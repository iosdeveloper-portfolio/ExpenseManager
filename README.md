## Dependencies

[Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) :- We use Alamofire to perform basic networking tasks like uploading files and requesting data from a third-party RESTful API. This property determines the maximum number of simultaneous connections made to each host by tasks within sessions based on this configuration. 
Networking in Alamofire is done asynchronously. Asynchronous programming may be a source of frustration to programmers unfamiliar with the concept, but there are [very good reasons](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/qa/qa1693/_index.html) for doing it this way.

[AlamofireNetworkActivityIndicator](https://github.com/Alamofire/AlamofireNetworkActivityIndicator) :- Controls the visibility of the network activity indicator on iOS using Alamofire.

[DTPhotoViewerController](https://github.com/tungvoduc/DTPhotoViewerController) :- Displaying multiple receipt image on full screen mode. It's fully customizable photo viewer ViewController to display single photo or collection of photos.
